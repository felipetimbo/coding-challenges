# You're playing Battleship on a grid of cells with R rows and C columns. There are # 0 or more 
# battleships on the grid, each occupying a single distinct cell. The cell in the 
# ith row from the top and jth column from the left either contains a battleship (G_ij=1) or doesn't (G_ij=0)

# You're going to fire a single shot at a random cell in the grid. You'll choose this cell uniformly at random 
# from the Râˆ—C possible cells. You're interested in the probability that the cell hit by your shot contains a 
# battleship.

# Sample test case #1
# R = 2
# C = 3
# G = 0 0 1
#     1 0 1
# Expected Return Value = 0.50000000

# Sample test case #2
# R = 2
# C = 2
# G = 1 1
#     1 1
# Expected Return Value = 1.00000000
